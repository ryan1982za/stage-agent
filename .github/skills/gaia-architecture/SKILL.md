description: Provides Gaia architecture documentation guidance that keeps docs, README messaging, and design decisions aligned to the current operating model. Use it by updating the relevant files under /docs/architecture/ (system components, use cases, class diagrams, UI) before any planning or implementation that changes structure, then resolving doc↔code drift before resuming feature work. Use it when system structure, trust boundaries, interfaces, workflows, ownership, or architectural assumptions change, or when architecture drift blocks planning or delivery.

# Gaia Architecture

## Scope and when to use

Use this skill to keep `docs/architecture` current and concrete enough that the
rest of Gaia can plan and deliver against a stable target solution.

Use this skill when:

- the operating model, system structure, or trust boundaries change
- `docs/architecture` is missing or stale
- README messaging must be aligned to architecture changes
- planning or testing expose a design ambiguity that blocks progress

Do not use this skill when:

- the issue is only execution order or branch sequencing
- the problem is purely local implementation work
- the only remaining question is final release readiness

## Required inputs

- the current request and approved constraints
- existing `docs/architecture` content or evidence that it is absent
- relevant contract, README, agent, and skill definitions
- architecture templates and shared ownership rules

## Owned outputs

- current architecture docs under `docs/architecture`
- explicit assumptions, invariants, and out-of-scope statements
- README alignment when the high-level system story changed
- clear downstream impact notes for planners and maintainers

## Decision tree

- If no baseline exists, document the current implemented system first.
- If only the story changed but not the design, update README and architecture summaries without inventing a new delta.
- If planning cannot proceed because architecture is vague, make the missing decision explicit before handoff.
- If implementation or validation defects do not imply a design change, route them back to the true owner instead of redesigning the system.

## Core workflow

1. Assess the repo, docs, README, and operating definitions for drift.
2. Decide whether the change is a real architecture delta or a justified no-op.
3. Update the relevant architecture artifacts using the provided templates.
4. Keep the architecture docs specific enough for planning and QA to act on.
5. Align README language when the user-facing Gaia story changed materially.
6. Hand off any agent or skill maintenance implied by the new design.

## Artifact selection order

- start with system components when the runtime or ownership model changes
- add or update use cases when workflow behavior or actor responsibilities change
- update class or data views only when structural detail improves the design basis
- align README after the architecture set is internally consistent

## Failure recovery

| Failure mode                               | Recovery                                       | Owner     | Escalation                         |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| missing baseline                           | create the baseline from current repo behavior | architect | block planning until complete      |
| unclear request                            | obtain clearer scope or constraints            | intake    | stay upstream                      |
| downstream role requests design workaround | restate the design or reject the workaround    | architect | escalate unresolved contradictions |
| README drift after design change           | update README after architecture stabilizes    | architect | block release messaging claims     |

## Anti-patterns

- do not treat architecture as optional background material
- do not solve code defects by silently changing the design
- do not leave README claims inconsistent with the target solution
- do not push planning forward on implied architecture

## Handoff and downstream impact

- tell planning which artifacts are now authoritative
- tell engineering which invariants or boundaries must not be violated
- tell testing which behaviors, actors, or flows changed materially
- tell maintainers which agent or skill definitions must align with the new design

## Examples

- **Good fit:** create the initial `docs/architecture` baseline for the Gaia plugin repository before rewriting its operating definitions.
- **Good fit:** update system boundaries after the contract adds explicit delegation and failure routing.
- **Not a fit:** publish a branch plan or implement the definition changes directly.

## Completion checklist

- affected architecture artifacts are current or explicitly no-op
- assumptions, invariants, and out-of-scope items are named
- README drift is resolved when the system story changed
- downstream roles know what changed and what artifact to read first
