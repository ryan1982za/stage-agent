description: Provides Gaia's formal validation guidance across unit, integration, manual regression, automated regression, and evidence review. Use it by running the test layers required by each task's gates (unit → integration → e2e → manual regression), recording proof labels (e.g. 'curl', 'playwright-mcp') on tasks_complete, and vetoing completion when evidence is missing. Use it when a branch is stable enough for hardening, when high-risk behavior needs targeted early validation, or when release readiness depends on a clear QA signal.

# Gaia Testing

## Scope and when to use

Use this skill to turn validation into explicit evidence and explicit ownership,
not just a vague "tests passed" summary.

Use this skill when:

- a stable branch needs formal validation or regression hardening
- high-risk behavior needs targeted early QA
- UI, integration, or user-visible behavior requires direct observation
- release readiness needs a clear QA outcome with supporting evidence

Do not use this skill when:

- the branch is too unstable for meaningful validation
- acceptance criteria are missing and need planning work first
- the only remaining task is interpreting release gates

## Required inputs

- the branch or deliverable under test
- acceptance criteria, architecture context, and identified risk areas
- relevant environments, commands, fixtures, or browser flows
- existing validation artifacts that should be extended or replaced

## Owned outputs

- validation artifacts and evidence appropriate to the change
- explicit pass, fail, or blocked outcomes
- true-owner routing for defects or blockers
- QA notes that a release reviewer can use directly

## Decision tree

- If the branch is not stable, send it back to engineering.
- If criteria are missing or contradictory, send the work to planning.
- If validation reveals design drift, route to architecture.
- If validation passes, package the evidence for release review.
- If only targeted early validation is warranted, scope it narrowly and say what remains for full hardening.

## Core workflow

1. Choose the validation layers that match the risk and surface area.
2. Add or update the required tests, fixtures, or manual validation notes.
3. Validate user-visible behavior directly when visuals or browser flows matter.
4. Record pass, fail, or blocked outcomes with evidence and true-owner routing.
5. Hand successful evidence to release review and unsuccessful evidence to the real failure owner.

## Coverage layers

- use focused unit or structural checks for local logic and small rule changes
- use integration validation for cross-component behavior and boundaries
- use browser or manual regression when user-visible flow or visual quality matters
- scale evidence to the risk of the change instead of chasing raw coverage numbers

## Failure recovery

| Failure mode     | Recovery                                      | Owner  | Escalation |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------- |
| unstable branch  | stop formal QA and request stabilization      | tester | engineer   |
| missing criteria | request plan clarification                    | tester | planner    |
| design mismatch  | surface architecture drift                    | tester | architect  |
| weak evidence    | strengthen validation before passing the work | tester | stay in QA |

## Anti-patterns

- do not equate DOM presence with user-visible correctness
- do not hide planning or design defects inside generic failing test notes
- do not approve a branch with weak or incomplete evidence
- do not assume automated checks alone are enough for visual or UX-sensitive work

## Handoff and downstream impact

- give release the exact evidence needed for a readiness call
- give engineering precise reproduction details for implementation defects
- give planning the missing criteria when validation is blocked by ambiguity
- give architecture the mismatch when documented behavior and observed behavior diverge

## Examples

- **Good fit:** review Gaia's rewritten definitions for coherence, line-count compliance, and supporting evidence.
- **Good fit:** use browser automation or manual regression notes for user-visible Copilot plugin workflows.
- **Not a fit:** decide what the success criteria should be when the plan never defined them.

## Completion checklist

- the outcome is clearly pass, fail, or blocked
- evidence matches the risk and surface area of the branch
- the true failure owner is named when the result is not a pass
- release review can proceed without guessing what QA actually proved
